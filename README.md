# Pre-work - tip calculator application for iOS

Submitted by: Che Chao Hsu

Time spent: **60** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Snapping sliders with dynamic range
- [x] Split tab

## Notes

Wasted a day with working (that wouldn't build) code--starting the project with copy-n-pasted code built just fine.
Optionals are/were confusing.
Math doesn't quite add up with 2 decimal place accuracy.
